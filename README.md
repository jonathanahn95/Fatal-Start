Fatal-Start is a side-scroller browser game inspired by the classic tv series Dragon Ball Z. The objective of the game is to help Goku defeat the enemies and survive as long as possible.

## Technologies Used
Fatal-Start is built using ES6 syntax JavaScript and HTML5 canvas to render elements onto the screen. At every requestAnimationFrame, the canvas is cleared of all elements on the screen and re-draws them based on their new coordinates.


## Features
This app will consist of a single screen with a header that consists of my name email, game name, and nav links to the 
to the Github, my LinkedIn, and personal website. It will have a modal about the game instructions. Game controls will include W,S,A,D to move and left click on the mouse to attack.

## Future Implementation

### Sprites
Add sprite animations for when objects collide and smoother transition for Goku turning super-saiyan.

### High Score
Implement Google Firebase to keep track of highest scores.

### Additional Features
Increase number of enemies from tv-series and add more abilities for Goku.
